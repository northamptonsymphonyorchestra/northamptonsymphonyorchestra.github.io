<h3>Friends Scheme</h3>
<p align="left">Northampton Symphony Orchestra re-launched
its Friends Scheme during the 2002 ~ 2003 Season to help strengthen
the links with our audience. For many in the orchestra the
highlight of each season is the exclusive Friends' Summer Concert and
Buffet, which provides an opportunity to meet and thank in person many
of the people whose generous support helps make the Orchestra such a
success. Everyone who is able to attend thoroughly enjoys the event.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left"><br>
Friends of NSO receive the following
benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left">Discounted ticket prices&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
</li>
<li><b><i>Free</i></b> programme for
each NSO concert&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
<li>
<div align="left">Priority booking</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left">Two <i><b>free</b></i>
tickets to the Friends'
exclusive Summer Concert and Buffet</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left">Regular newsletters</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left">Invitations to open rehearsals</div>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>Becoming
a Friend costs just £20.00 per
season,
and your membership fee is recovered by joining the orchestra for the
exclusive concert and buffet - the discount on concert tickets
represents an additional saving. You only need to purchase tickets for
the concerts you are able to attend, rather than subscribing to the
entire season. Joining the Friends Scheme helps the orchestra forward
plan, thus helping to ensure the
future success of one of the finest community orchestras in the
country.
