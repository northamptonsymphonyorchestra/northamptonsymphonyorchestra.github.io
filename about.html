        <p>Founded in 1893, the Northampton Symphony Orchestra is widely
        regarded as one of the United Kingdom's top amateur symphony
        orchestras. Our membership is drawn from excellent amateurs, teachers, former
        professional musicians and students in and around
        Northamptonshire. Most members have achieved at least Grade VIII on
        their instrument.</p>

        <p>We <a href="concerts.html">perform regularly</a> in
        Northampton's many classical music
        venues with top professional soloists in repertoire
        that encompasses all styles of classical music. Rehearsals usually
        take place on a <a href="members.html">Wednesday evening</a> during
        school term time.</p>

        <p>We are supported by an active and flourishing
        <a href="friends.html">Friends' scheme</a> that provides many
        <em>exclusive</em> benefits for supporters.</p>

        <p>The Northampton Symphony Orchestra's excellence in
        amateur music making has led to invitations to play in various
        local music festivals (such as the one celebrating local composer,
        Malcolm Arnold and the Northampton Music Festival) and collaborations with other local music
        ensembles.</p>
        
        <p>We are supported in continuing musical excellence by our Musical Director, John Gibbons BEM and our Leader, Emily Groom. The NSO's committee is comprised of volunteers, and we are represented in the Northamptonshire community by our President and former principal trumpet, Nick Bunker.</p>

        <p>We sometimes have vacancies our string sections and maintain an active deputies/wait list for other sections. If you are interested in joining the
        orchestra please <a href="https://forms.gle/Jn1AYESPzNDGdhtw6">apply here</a>.</p>
