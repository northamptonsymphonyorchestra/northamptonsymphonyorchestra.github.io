       <h1>A Word from the Committee of the NSO</h1>

       <p>Given the uncertainty of the current situation, and the impossibility of meeting for rehearsals for the time being, the committee has taken the difficult decision to suspend the orchestra’s activities until at least January 2021, unless government guidance changes dramatically.  We hope to be able to start rehearsing and performing in the new year, but as you will appreciate, it is dependent on government advice at that time.  The committee remains committed to our mission, and is supporting several efforts to keep the orchestra going while we are unable to meet in person. </p>
        <p>We will also be announcing a new set of programmes for our shortened season.  This is in recognition that the orchestra will have been paused for quite some time when we meet again.  I know you will share my disappointment at not being able to participate in our Music She Wrote plans for the upcoming season, but I can assure you whatever performances and experiences we plan will be exciting and enjoyable.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we will be publishing a regular newsletter for our members, Friends and the community.  This contains information about the orchestra, our continuing activities during this time, and even some fun activities. To each of you viewing this page, please stay safe and healthy.  We look forward to seeing you again as soon as we can.</p>
