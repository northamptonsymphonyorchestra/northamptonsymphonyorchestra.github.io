<h4>From "A Century of Music Making" by Ian McLauchlan</h4>
<p>The origins of Northampton Symphony Orchestra are to be found
in the
"St. Cecilia Orchestral Society", which was formed in October 1893.
Members were invited by an advertisement in the local papers, and the
first practice was held at the Unitarian Schoolroom on 24 October 1893.
The orchestra, conducted by William Bonner, met for weekly practices
until 21 December, when the members were called upon to elect a
committee for the future management of the Society. Isidore de Solla
agreed to become the first President, and a committee of eight members
was elected, including William Bonner (Conductor) and Charles Furniss
(Secretary). The subscription fee was set at two shillings and six
pence a quarter.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>After resumption of weekly practices in early 1894, the
Society's first concert was given at Northampton Town Hall (the
Guildhall) on Saturday
20 January 1894. The orchestra consisted of forty players, with the
soloists Miss James (contralto) and Mr Francis Pickman (baritone). A
programme comprising a large number of short, light pieces - including
popular songs - generated an enthusiastic press report. "The hall was
crowded in every part and the audience would have numbered hundreds
more if the walls had been elastic.....The performance of the new
orchestral society and the reception they met with showed pretty
clearly the existence of a considerable body of earnest
instrumentalists and of a ready spirit of appreciation on the part of
the public. The Society has only been in existence three months, and
the progress made is already surprising."</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>In 1932 the orchestra gave the first performance under its new
name of Northampton Symphony Orchestra. The March 1933 concert was
distinguished by the first half of the programme (Beethoven Leonore
No.3 overture and Tchaikovsky's Pathetique symphony) being broadcast by
the BBC. In 1937 the name Malcolm Arnold appeared in the programme: the
well-known Northampton-born composer played in the trumpet section as a
young lad. Regular concerts (interrupted only by the Second World War)
were given in the New Theatre (long since demolished), the Royal
Theatre, the Guildhall, Derngate and Spinney Hill Theatre. Since 1983
the orchestra has given the majority of its concerts in Northampton but
has also played in other venues outside the town.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Members of the NSO are drawn from all walks of life including
students, musical instrument
teachers and professionals from many different businesses. They give up
their time without being paid, and share the
common purpose of enjoying music and hoping to communicate that
enjoyment with others. The financial policy of the Orchestra, in
keeping with its status as a registered charity, is to secure
sufficient funds through members' subscription fees, ticket
sales,&nbsp;grants and donations to meet the costs of rehearsals
and performances, and nothing
more.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Northampton Symphony Orchestra's reputation has grown over the
last
century, and continues to do so. It has been described as one of the
foremost community orchestras in the country, and with the support of
its members, patrons and audience it intends to live up to this
accolade. </p>
